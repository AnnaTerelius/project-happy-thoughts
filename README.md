This project was to build our own version of Twitter called Happy Thoughts in React
by fetching and posting data to an API, using React state.
You should be able to send a Happy thought and also click the heartbutton to like a thought.
If I had more time I would have made it responsive and aimed for some strechgoals such as a spinner when loading the API and error handeling.
